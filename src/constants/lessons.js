            In this lesson, we’ll learn about social engineering. Social
            engineering can take on many forms, one of which is digging into
            someone’s personal information to gain access to their accounts.

            We want to hack into Caitlin’s account. Suppose Hackerman already
            gave us Caitlin’s username and password, but we need to answer some
            security questions!
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Luckily, we have access to her Instagram posts, so let’s see if we
            can social engineer the answers by doing a little research! Try
            looking through Caitlin’s Instagram posts to answer the security
            questions for her account.

          <Typography>
            As you can see, social engineering is quite a powerful tool! In this
            case, Caitlin made the mistake of using security questions that
            anyone with access to her Instagram could answer.

            However, hackers can socially engineer information in other ways.
            For example, they can use fraudulent phone calls, emails, or texts
            impersonating someone you trust (like your bank or maybe a
            co-worker).

            Always be cautious with your online security, and be especially wary
            when providing someone with your private credentials or information.
